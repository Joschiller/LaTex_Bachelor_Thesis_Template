% Insert bibliography here
% If using Citavi for managing references, the bibliography can be exported via "File -> Export".
% Make sure to select "BibLaTeX" for the export format as this includes all required fields.
% Always check the acronyms of the sources after exporting as Citavi sometimes changes the order of some references and therefore may switch elements in the list.
% Therefore, usage of Git is advised to check new versions of the bibliography!
